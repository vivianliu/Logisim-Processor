To use this framework, copy your solution into this directory and then run

./autograder_limited_part2.py -here

from this directory.

The autograder works by running Logisim in a command-line mode, which shows all of the ouputs
of your processor after every clock tick. Your processor's outputs should match the reference
ones.

The expected outputs are the *.out files. The *-test.circ files are harnesses with a program
loaded into them. The *.s and *.hex files are the source and assembled version of the test
programs, respectively.

If you want to find out how your output differs from the standard output, run something like
the following command (this example is for the test of the disp instruction):

java -jar logisim-generic-2.7.1.jar -tty table disp-test.circ  | head -n `cat disp.out | wc -l` | diff - disp.out

This diffs the correct number of lines of your processor's output with the reference output.
Unfortunately Logisim will keep running after head has consumed all the output that it will
consume, so you should manually stop the process with Control-C after awhile.

DISCLAIMER: I HAVE NOT RELEASED ALL THE TESTS WE WILL BE RUNNING ON YOUR PROCESSOR. I HAVE NOT EVEN
RELEASED TESTS THAT COVER ALL REQUIRED INSTRUCTIONS. YOU SHOULD TEST YOUR PROCESSOR BEYOND THESE
SIMPLE TESTS GIVEN HERE; THIS IS INTENDED TO HELP YOU TEST, NOT OBVIATE THE NEED FOR YOU TO TEST
YOUR OWN ASSIGNMENT.
